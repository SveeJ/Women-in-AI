# #WAI
#WAI bot is a real time automations solution built on commission for the Women in AI (#WAI) company that works on the discord.js API and deals
with server side conference security, security key generation and valid member authentication. This was essential for maintaining the integrity of these
widely coveted global conferences conducted in online mode due to COVID-19. 

## How to run the app
1. Either fork or install the app and open the folder in cli
2. Install all dependencies using `npm i` command
3. Run the app using the app run scripts after changing the bot token to your own discord API bot token to run the bot on your server

## Features
 - Generating security keys
 - Safe storage of keys in SSH encrypted Mongo database
 - User authentication 
 - User roles allocation based on class of key entered
 
 ## WARNING
 This project is deprecated now. It runs on old versions of discord.js. It was made to be an on commission project for the #WAI company that used it for 
 their 2020-2021 conference held in online mode. Hence, no further work has been done on it and it is now being made public as legacy.
